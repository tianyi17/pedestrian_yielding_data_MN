The data collection took place at 18 intersections in Minnesota. Data collection was conducted at 18 sites across Minnesota to capture various road types, and intersection features during the summer months. The TIMs were deployed to each location for between one and two weeks, and video was recorded during daylight hours only. The Minnesota Traffic Observatory (MTO) used the Traffic Information Monitors (TIMs) to collect video data at each site. Raw video data will be available upon request. The collected video data is reduced to numeric data using both video processing techniques and manual data extraction.
