The data collection took place at 18 intersections in Minnesota. Fifteen of them are collected in the summer of 2021, which is in addition to previously collected data. The other three sites were instrumented in the fall of 2020 as a pilot study. The Minnesota Traffic Observatory (MTO) used the Traffic Information Monitors (TIMs) to collect video data at each site. Raw video data will be available upon request. The collected video data is reduced to numeric data using both video processing techniques and manual data extraction.
